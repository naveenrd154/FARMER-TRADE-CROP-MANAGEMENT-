# FARMER-TRADE-CROP-MANAGEMENT-
Created a C-based application to help farmers manage crop details, pricing, and trade records efficiently. Implemented modules for crop data entry, buyer–seller transactions, and profit tracking using file handling and structures. Designed a user-friendly, menu-driven interface to simplify agricultural trade management and data storage.
